## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

# Software Impementation Project
====================================
## Setting up project
Please ensure that:
1. laravel and
2. composer are already setup on your machine before proceeding.
2. PHP is installed on your machine
3. An Apache server via Xammp, Wamp or LAMP
[installing laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/installation)
[installing composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
4. create a database(mySql) name mdl. visit http://localhost/phpmyadmin/


After cloning the project, cd into the directory and run the following command(s):
1. **composer install**, this install the project depemdencies
2. **composer update**, updates the project depemcies
3. **php artisan migrate**, migrates database tables to the database
4. **php artisan db:seed**, creates default data in the database. Will also create the roles and permissions in the database and link each user type(role) to its appropriate set of permissions.


## Starting the server/ running the project
run the command **php artisan serve

# User types(roles)
========================================================
There are three user types:
1. admin
2. clerk
3. customer

## user roles-permissions
=========================================================

**admin**
Permissions: 
1. add stock
2. delete stock
3. update stock
4. view stock
5. view customers
6. view customer quotes
7. add user
8. delete user

In the interest of time, we probably won't implement number 7 to 8. Number 1 to 6 are oarts of the the core functions of the system and are also the permissions that a clerk has.


**clerk**
Permissions:
1. add stock
2. delete stock
3. update stock
4. view stock
5. view customers
6. view customer quotes

**customer**
Permissions:
view items

2 .get quote
3. view cart
4. edit cart
5. delete cart item

# Default users
